  "passage": "This is the second study of three year(2013-2015) study and aims to draw optimal generation mix taking account of economic and social costs of nuclear generation. In the first year, we focused on modeling that can be used in optimal generation mix and collected related basic data. In the second year, we focus on the external costs of generating technologies and in the third year, we would draw a optimal generation mix taking account of economic and social costs of nuclear based on the information accumulated in the first and second year.",
  "summary": "Aims to draw optimal generation mix taking about economic and social costs of nuclear generation. We would draw it based on the the first and second year."
